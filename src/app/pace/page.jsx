        Pace Recruitment
      </h1>

      <p className="opacity-60 text-[15px] md:text-[18px]">
        Pace is a recruitment app created to help people get jobs within
        their community. It also helps employers simplify the recruitment
        process. This case study is focused on the jobseeker‚Äôs side of
        things and understanding what the process of putting together a
        usable product for a jobseeker was like.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-60 pt-8 text-[15px] md:text-[18px]">
        Pace already existed before but I worked on a version update with
        multiple changes. Pace previously catered to just people in the tech
        space but a market was seen within the rising number of unemployed
        people outside the tech space and how to bridge the gap between
        employers and applicants, it splits in two (the jobseeker‚Äôs side and
        the employer‚Äôs side) and while I designed for both set of people at
        separate times, it was very important to not lose focus of who I was
        designing for at each point. This case study focuses on the
        jobseeker‚Äôs problems, the design process, the solution that was
        introduced and how these solutions would solve problems we believe
        our competitors aren‚Äôt solving.

        HIGH FIDELITY DESIGNS
      </h1>
      <p className="opacity-60 text-[15px] md:text-[18px]">
        Creating these designs came after I had sketched out flows on papers
        and then created wireframes, I used Balsamiq for the wireframes of
        this project. Creating wireframes made it much easier to create the
        high fidelity designs although with the time constraint the
        wireframes were a bit rushed but because I had the flow I wanted for
        this work in my head, converting to high fidelity designs were easy
